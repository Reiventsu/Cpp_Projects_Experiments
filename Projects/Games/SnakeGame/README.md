## Snake Game

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project uses [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) you will not be able to successfully compile the project without the library.

### Goals
- Use raylib
  - Learn to import libraries
- Follow the [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/LGqsnM_WEK4?si=SsRK6Q5oAe8VNbuw) on how to make a snake game
- Learn how to change it from the final product in the YouTube video (add something or change something)

Focus of this project is to create a small snake game simply because I want to, and within the first moments I've already encountered
my first problem. Importing libraries to use. I have many options, either try to manually add it or make from source, use vcpkg or conan.
I haven't decided which way to go yet, but I'll be testing the different routes out.

> [!TIP] 
> #### Controls
> Use the arrow keys to move the snake, when the snake "dies" 
by hitting the wall or itself it will reset to initial position. 
Use ESC or close the game window to quit.
