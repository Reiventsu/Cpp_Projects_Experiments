## Snake Game
### Goals
- Use raylib
  - Learn to import libraries
- Learn the basics of taking user input in context of game input.
- Follow the [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/LGqsnM_WEK4?si=SsRK6Q5oAe8VNbuw) on how to make a snake game.
- Have a playable game

Focus of this project is to create a small snake game simply because I want to, and within the first moments I've already encountered
my first problem. Importing libraries to use. I have many options, either try to manually add it or make from source, use vcpkg or conan.
I haven't decided which way to go yet, but I'll be testing the different routes out.
