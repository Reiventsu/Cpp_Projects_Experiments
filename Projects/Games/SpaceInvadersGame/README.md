## Space Invaders Game

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project uses [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) you will not be able to compile the project without the library.

### Goals
- Follow the [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/TGo3Oxdpr5o?si=f3DJFexPSLh6TJY0) on how to make a space invaders game
- After completing the tutorial try to review the code and rewrite it for best practices and better readability.
- Follow the holy gospel of Clang-Tidy
- Become self-sufficient enough to attempt to make a game myself without a YouTube tutorial.

I'm going to follow the video in its whole before I start changing stuff this time around, so I will ignore the Clang-Tidy till after
I'm done writing the code to see how that changes my understanding of the program and the code I'm altering.

  however I'll give it a shot next time.
