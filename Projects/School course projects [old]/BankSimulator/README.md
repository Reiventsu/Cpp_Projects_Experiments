## Bank simulator
### Goals
- Store currency
- Support depositing, withdrawing and interest.
- Prevent user error or program locks.

This was one of my earlier assignments where my task was to simply be able to
handle basic currency, and being an overachiever I made the best damn bank simulator I could at the time.
I managed to neatly tie it all together in a little command line program and even today I think I feel pretty happy with
the clean and simple program I made here.
