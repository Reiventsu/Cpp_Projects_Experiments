## Info
The projects under this folder are older and from my fundamental programming course in school, They are written using a lot of swedish in comments
I don't know how much of it I'll get to translating but one day I hope to have translated a bit of the stuff so it'll
be easier for everyone to see my thinking and decision-making process.

I at the moment have one project missing from that time
I have contacted the school I studied at to see if I may be lucky since it's a BMI calculator type application I was pretty proud of
so it'd be a shame to lose that one.
