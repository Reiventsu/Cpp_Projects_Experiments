## Student grading tool and constructor
### Goals
- Use a struct
- Use a class
- Create a clean program with as little repeating code as possible
- Prevent user error in as many places as possible.

This is a tool that set out with the goal to be able to construct a simple object, 
in this instance a student who has a name, last name and age which is created with a struct. 
I then made a class for the grades, 
I researched best practices a lot and asked for input by people better than me. 
I learnt about making constructors with base values to avoid the compiler deciding initial values by itself.
I do a lot of asking when i program like "Surely there would be a more efficient way to do this?" Which is one of the reasons
I made that template that's present in A LOT of my programs because it's a generally useful tool.

> *Author note: I feel a lot more energetic today and my documentation probably reflects that, I may go back and tune up
old documentation at some point. Also the order I've been uploading my old school projects is very random.*

Project status: Complete!

Planned fixes: 
- Translation of code comments pending
- May strip helper functions out of 'main.cpp' and into their own '.h'
