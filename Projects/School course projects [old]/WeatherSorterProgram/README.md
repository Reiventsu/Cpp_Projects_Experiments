# Weather program sort thing
This project was the result of a school assignment where one of the focuses were to learn sorting and whatnot.
I'm going to be honest I have no clue what I wrote, I'm going to lazily and roughly translate it from Swedish to English and then just let it speak for itself, I am going to have to revisit how to do this as honestly I can't read my own code very well, shocker I know.
### Goals
Some of the goals when making this project was to create modular and reusable code with easy implementation through function calling, I don't know how well I did because honestly again after 5 months I can barely recall what I did.
