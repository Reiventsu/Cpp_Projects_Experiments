### Goals
- Create lists
- Sort the list
- Search the list based on given condition

This was one of my later assignments where my task was to create a list with types and assign values,
to sort them given different arguments I decided to have a few sort methods for the program, and it was revised once to
change how the search method worked but my memory is for some reason very spotty on this project, which is a shame cus I do
remember working really hard on it.
