# C++ Practice, Experiments, Projects

This is a collection of the experiments and projects I make for myself to learn and test. I share this source code both for purposes of education as well as a way for me to look back at what I've done to learn C++

## About the sub-directories

The sub-directories of the repository are all named as accurately as possible to the project in question, they should all contain a README for information on what the starting goals of the project were and what I learnt during it. Documentation is done in code where possible.

## Permissions
You may use this collection of projects as you see fit whether it be to study, educate, create derivations or further, it is up to you. The knowledge is free and available.

## License
The code in this repository is subject to the [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit) license however I appreciate if you let people know where the code was gotten from as they too may find help from perusing all my mistakes.
